## Running

To run the ai, run the following commands:
```bash
cd ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Optionally, you can specify the config and pieces paths:
```bash
python main.py --config-path ../custom_config.json --pieces-path ../custom_pieces.json
```

> [!TIP]
> If any of these commands don't work, e.g. you get a "command not found: pip" error, try using `pip3` and `python3` instead of `pip` and `python`, respectively.
